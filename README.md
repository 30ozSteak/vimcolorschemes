## Welcome ðŸŽ‰

[vimcolorschemes](https://vimcolorschemes.com) is a **minimal** and **fast** gallery for vim color scheme repositories on GitHub.

This solves an old problem of mine, which is to find the **perfect color scheme** for my vim setup. Syntax color in a coding environment is a big part of what makes it yours and **yours only**.

GitHub holds an impressive amount of vim color schemes. It is not easy to navigate through them, though. Checking out a couple to find a nice one can take a while.

This is where [vimcolorschemes](https://vimcolorschemes.com) steps in. It's **focused on content**, and **it feels awesome** to navigate through.

## Key features ðŸš€

- **Awesome vim (or arrows) key bindings** to navigate quickly through the whole site
