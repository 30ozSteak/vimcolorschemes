## Welcome ðŸŽ‰

[colorschemes.dev](https://colorschemes.dev) is an app template to create a **fast** and **fun** gallery for color scheme repositories on GitHub.

This solves an old problem of mine, which is to find the **perfect color scheme** for my IDE. Syntax color in a coding environment is a big part of what makes it yours and **yours only**.

GitHub holds an impressive amount of color schemes. It is not easy to navigate through them, though. Checking out a couple to find a nice one can take a while.

This is where [colorschemes.dev](https://colorschemes.dev) steps in. It is **minimal**, **focused on content**, and **it feels awesome** to navigate through.

The project started with vim only but was expanded to support **any platform**.
