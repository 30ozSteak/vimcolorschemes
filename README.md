[colorschemes.dev](https://colorschemes.dev) solves an old problem of mine, which is to find the perfect color scheme for my IDE. Syntax color in a coding environment is a big part of what makes and IDE yours and yours only.

The project started with vim only but was expanded to any platform.

GitHub is an awesome source for color schemes. There are literally thousands available on the platform. It is not easy to navigate through them, though. Checking out a couple to find a nice one can take a while.

This is where [colorschemes.dev](https://colorschemes.dev) comes in. It creates a **fast** and **fun** gallery to navigate color schemes.
