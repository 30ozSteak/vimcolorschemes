  Find the best color schemes around for <i>virtually</i> any platform

## Welcome ðŸŽ‰

**colorschemes** solves an old problem of mine, which is to find the perfect color scheme for my IDE. The project started with vim only but was expanded to any platform. Syntax color in a coding environment is a big part of what makes and IDE yours and yours only.

GitHub is an awesome source for color schemes. There are literally thousands available on the platform. It is not easy to navigate through them, though. Checking out a couple to find a nice one can take a while.

This is where **colorschemes** comes in. It creates a **fast** and **fun** gallery to navigate color schemes.

## Key features ðŸš€

- **Daily updated** list of thousands of color scheme repositories
- **Awesome vim (or arrows) key bindings** to navigate quickly through the whole site
